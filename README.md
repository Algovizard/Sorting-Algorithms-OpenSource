# Sorting-Algorithm-OpenSource

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

Below are the types of Algorithms and their time complexities :



We decided to keep this project open source as we are collecting all types of sorting programs from the contribution and we are planning to do sorting visualization 
project based on this repository . 

The folk's who are contributing to this repository have to chance to learn and implement various types of sorting programs in different forms and Languages .


to contribute to this Repository you should simply implement Sorting algorithms in different languages you know .
rename your file with which type of sort you Applied !  
And make a pull request !
That's it !

This is open-source repository.
